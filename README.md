## Introduction

The MODI method is a mathematical optimization technique used for finding the optimal solution for transportation problems. This app allows users to input their cost and initial allocation matrices, and it calculates the optimal transportation plan along with the total cost.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting cost and initial allocation matrices.
- Real-time calculation of the optimal transportation plan using the MODI method.
- Display of the optimal allocation matrix and total transportation cost.
- Handles degeneracy and provides error messages for invalid inputs.

## Usage

1. Open the web app in your browser. You can access it [here](https://transportationproblemsolver.streamlit.app/).
2. Input the number of rows and columns for the cost matrix.
3. Enter the values for each row of the cost matrix as prompted.
4. Enter the values for each row of the initial allocation matrix as prompted.
5. Click the "Generate Optimal Solution" button to compute the optimal allocation and total cost.
6. The results will be displayed on the page, including the optimal allocation matrix and the total transportation cost.
